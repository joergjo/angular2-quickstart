# angular2-quickstart
This is a clone of the original [Angular 2 QuickStart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) set up to be used with 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It includes a [TypeScript build task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/language/typescript#_transpiling-typescript-into-javascript), so you can compile your project at any time (`CTRL-SHIFT-B`).
Note that the build task is configured to **not** produce any output files, because the QuickStart performs the actual transpilation on the fly when running the project with `npm start`. The build task is therefore simply meant to validate that all TypeScript source files can be transpiled.
